## GuessWho

###Mission:
While building this game, our team always keep in mind three main missions:
1. To learn OOP from another view - design level; to use UML to present and facilitate the process of designing; and to apply different design pattern in Java.
2. To nurture computer science knowledge and thoughtful analysis in children by choosing an algorithm taken from csunflugged.org and create an attractive yet simple-to-deliver game based on that.
3. To help peers without computer science background understand how useful a certain algorithm is and how to apply it in real life.
